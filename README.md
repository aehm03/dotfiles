# my dotfiles
Uses:
* dotbot for linking and idemdpotent install
* ohmyzsh 
* Brewfile for basic applications
* Some custom stuff

Install: `./install`

Note:
* The zshrc file from ohmyzsh is forcefully overwritten by the dotbot installer. I found no workaround for that. If this file changes in ohmyzsh, it must be updated from hand. 
* The theme for iterm must be installed by hand
* Fonts for powerline10k must be installed with `p10k configure`

Todo:

* decoupling of os specific stuff(?)
