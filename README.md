# my dotfiles

Uses:
* dotbot for linking and idemdpotent install
* ohmyzsh 
* some custom stuff

Note:
* The zshrc file from ohmyzsh is forcefully overwritten by the dotbot installer. I found no workaround for that. If this file changes in ohmyzsh, it must be updated from hand. 
* The solarized theme for iterm must be installed by hand

Todo:
* brewfile for applications
* decoupling of os specific stuff(?)
